Allocation to technology stocks is significant in the portfolio (~55%) given the critical role the sector plays in enabling the future of transport.Growing, diversified and pure-play investment universe:In this fast-evolving industry, theinvestment team follows a disciplined process to constantly ensure the purity of the universe, by adding new and emerging companies related to the smart mobility theme, and removing stocks that no longer qualify as a pure play on the theme.
